The data generation pipeline we developed for generating our VoxelScape dataset is based on [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). The developed codes and add-ons can be found in the referenced submodule [voxelscape-lidarsim-blender-app-template](https://github.com/mhossny/voxelscape-lidarsim-blender-app-template/tree/38a16aeea9bde2fede05460c80ca7414af21c063).
